				<h1>The Python Tutorial</h1><br>
				
				<p> Python is a popular general-purpose programming language.
					In computer software, a general-purpose programming language [ GPL ] is used for 
					building a software in a wide variety of application domains, Conversely, a domain-specific programming language (DSL) is used within a specific area. <br>
					
					<br>For example, Python is a GPL, so it can be used in any domain such as 
					machine learning, Data Science,Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision or Image Processing Applications, web development, desktop applications, Mobile Applications, and many other fields.<br>
					
					<br>while SQL and HTML is a DSL, so SQL used for querying relational databases and HTML used for web-development.
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					Python is a great language for beginners, who wanted to master the core concept of programming because of it's  easy syntax.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<br>Spl Python tutorial will try to cover all of the Core concepts of the Python, which will help you to have a great level of expertise in Python, from where you can take yourself to the next levels to become a world class Software Engineer.
				</p><br><br>
				
				<!-- Why learn Python? -->
				<h1>Why learn Python?</h1><br>
				<p>
					Python is a very popular general-purpose, interpreted [ executes instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language ], interactive [ allows the Progrmmer to make changes to the program while it is already running ] , object-oriented [ a technique to solve problem ], and high-level programming language [ allow humans to write computer programs and interact with a computer system without having depth knowledge of the processor or hardware on which program will run ]. <br>
					
					<br>Python is dynamically-typed [languages that do not require any pre-defined data type for any variable as it is interpreted at runtime by the machine itself. In these languages, interpreters assign the data type to a variable at runtime depending on its value ] and garbage-collected[GC] programming language [ A GC-enabled programming language includes one or more garbage collectors (GC engines) that automatically free up memory space that has been allocated to objects no longer needed by the program ].<br>
					
					<br>It is free, created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).<br>
					
					<br>Python supports multiple programming paradigms [ approach/techniques to solve problem ], including Procedural, Object Oriented [ a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) and Attributes (variables) with which they are associated ] and Functional programming language [ specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications ].<br> 
					
					<br>Python design philosophy was code readability with use of significant indentation as block.<br>
					
					<br> Python has a simple syntax and powerful libraries that can help developers write code faster and more efficiently. This can increase productivity and save time for developers and organizations.<br>
					
					<br>Python has a vast and active community of developers contributing to its development and offering support. This makes it easy for beginners to get help and learn from experienced developers.<br>
					
					<br> Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, Django, and Flask, that can be used to solve a wide range of problems.<br>
					
					<br>Python code can be embedded into other applications as a scripting language<br>
					
					<br> It allows programmers to express complex concepts in just a few lines of code or reduces Developer's Time.<br>
					
					<br>Python has a simple and easy-to-understand syntax, unlike traditional languages like C, C++, Java, etc., making it easy for beginners to learn.<br>
				</p><br><br>
				
				<!-- Python Feature? -->
				<h1> Python Feature? </h1><br>
				<p>
					<li style="padding-left: 25px";>It supports structured and functional programming technique as well as OOP.</li>
					<li style="padding-left: 25px";>It supports very high-level dynamic data types and dynamic type checking.</li>
					<li style="padding-left: 25px";>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
					<li style="padding-left: 25px";>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
					<li style="padding-left: 25px";>it's interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++.</li>
					<li style="padding-left: 25px";>it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</li>
