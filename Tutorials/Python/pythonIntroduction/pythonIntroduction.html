				Python is a widely used high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. <br>
				It was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991. <br>
				Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and <br>
				its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java. <br>
				This makes it a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers. 
			</p>

			<h4><b>Here are some key features and aspects of Python:</b></h4>

			<p> <b>Easy-to-Read Syntax: </b><br>
				Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks,<br> 
				which makes the code visually clear and reduces the need for curly braces or explicit begin/end statements.
			</p>

			<p><b>Interpreted Language:</b> <br>
				Python is an interpreted language, which means you don't need to compile your code before running it. <br>
				The Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Dynamically Typed:</b> <br>
				Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. <br>
				The interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned to the variable.
			</p>

			<p><b>High-Level Data Types:</b> <br>
				Python provides a variety of high-level data types such as <p>
				lists, dictionaries, sets, and more, which simplify complex data structures and operations.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Extensive Standard Library:</b> <br>
				Python comes with a large standard library that provides modules and functions <br>
				for a wide range of tasks, from file I/O to web services, networking, and more.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Cross-Platform:</b> <br>
				Python is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and different flavors of Unix.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Open Source: </b><br>
				Python is an open-source language, meaning its source code is freely available, and you can contribute to its development.
			</br>
			
			<p><b>Large Community and Third-Party Packages: </b><br>
				Python has a vast and active community that contributes to its growth.<br>
				There are numerous third-party libraries and packages available through the Python Package Index (PyPI) that extend its capabilities.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Versatile: </b><br>
				Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, <br>
				scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Object-Oriented:</b> <br>
				Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, allowing you to create classes and objects,<br> 
				encapsulating data and functionality together.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Readability:</b> <br>
				The PEP 8 style guide provides coding conventions that encourage consistent and readable code.
			</p>
			
			<p>To get started with Python, you need to install the Python interpreter on your computer. <br>
				You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). <br>
				Once installed, you can write and run Python code using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
			</p>

			<p>Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:<br>
				<code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
			</p>
			
			<p>This is just a brief introduction to Python. <br>
				As you delve deeper into the language, you'll discover its rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, <br>
				and tools that can help you achieve a wide range of programming goals.
