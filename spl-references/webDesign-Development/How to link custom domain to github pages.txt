Linking a custom domain to a GitHub Pages repository involves a few steps. 
GitHub Pages allows you to host your static website on GitHub's servers and associate it with a custom domain. 

Here's a general guide to help you through the process:

>> Create a GitHub Repository:
   If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository that will host your website's static files. 
   The repository name should ideally follow this format: username.github.io where username is your GitHub username.

>> Set Up Your Website:
   Upload your website's static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to your GitHub repository. 
   Make sure your website works as expected when accessed through the default GitHub Pages domain (username.github.io).

>> Purchase a Custom Domain:
   Purchase a domain name from a domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains). 
   Choose a domain that you want to use for your website.

>> Configure DNS Settings:
   Log in to your domain registrar's control panel and navigate to the DNS settings for your purchased domain. 
   Here, you'll need to create DNS records to point to GitHub's servers. GitHub provides specific IP addresses for this purpose.

>> A Record: 
   Create an "A" record that points to GitHub's primary IP address: 185.199.108.153
   
   A Record: 
   Create three more "A" records with the following IP addresses: 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, and 185.199.111.153

>> CNAME Record: 
   Create a "CNAME" record that associates your custom domain with your GitHub Pages repository. 
   The CNAME value should be your GitHub username or repository name. 
   For example, if your repository is named "my-website," the CNAME value should be my-website.
   These DNS settings tell your custom domain where to find the GitHub Pages content.

>> Configure Repository Settings:
   In your GitHub repository, go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. 
   Under the "Custom domain" option, enter your custom domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).

>> Enforce HTTPS (Optional but Recommended):
   GitHub Pages provides free SSL certificates, enabling HTTPS for your website. 
   In the GitHub repository settings, ensure the "Enforce HTTPS" option is enabled.

>> Wait for DNS Propagation:
   DNS changes can take some time to propagate across the internet. 
   It might take several hours to up to 48 hours for your custom domain to start pointing to your GitHub Pages repository.

>> Test Your Custom Domain:
   Once DNS propagation is complete, open your web browser and enter your custom domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com) 
   to see if it's correctly linked to your GitHub Pages website.

>> Remember that domain registration and DNS settings can vary depending on the registrar you use. 
   The specific steps might differ slightly, so refer to your registrar's documentation if you encounter any issues.
